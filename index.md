## Why have I used only Jupyter notebooks?

These notebooks are for educational purposes only. Our experiments are relatively small scale and can be run in a reasonable amount of time in a notebook. I personally love the interactive nature of jupyter notebooks. We can see what we are doing. So the answer to the above question is: personal choice. I also don't intend to deploy these, at least for the time being, in a production environment. Readers who wish to build deployment ready systems should bear in mind that they have to do many other things than just run an algorithm in a jupyter notebook.
